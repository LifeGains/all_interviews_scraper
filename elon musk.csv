2023-10-11T01:00:13Z,UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ,Elon Musk's Twitter Takeover (full documentary) | FRONTLINE,"FRONTLINE traces Elon Musk’s long and often troubled relationship with Twitter, following his journey from being one of the platform’s most provocative users to becoming its owner.

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​.

Elon Musk completed his acquisition of the social media company formerly called Twitter nearly a year ago. At a time of intense polarization in the U.S. and worldwide, the move placed the richest man in the world in charge of one of the world’s most important platforms for news and political debate — and also put Musk squarely at the center of an ongoing debate about the limits of free speech and the spread of lies online.

This two-hour documentary from the team behind “Amazon Empire” and “The Facebook Dilemma” pulls back the curtain on the influential social media platform’s inner workings both before and after Musk’s takeover. In extraordinary, in-depth interviews, former Twitter employees give remarkable first-person accounts of how controversial content moderation decisions were made in the pre-Musk era, including the banning of former President Donald Trump after Jan. 6, 2021.

Former Twitter employees also give first-person accounts of the changes Musk made inside Twitter after buying the company, shedding new light on questions about free speech, hate speech and safety that have intensified during his tenure at the helm of the platform. “Elon Musk’s Twitter Takeover” probes the profound impact Musk’s decisions have had on politics, speech and culture.

“Elon Musk’s Twitter Takeover” is a FRONTLINE production with Left/Right Docs. The director and correspondent is James Jacoby. The writers and producers are Anya Bourg and James Jacoby. The co-producers are Christina Avalos and Chris O’Coin. The senior producers are Dan Edge and Frank Koughan. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

Every day Trump is getting closer and closer to winning the 2024 presidential election! It will be a huge event where the winner is already obvious. Pretty soon all the court cases will be over and Trump will be back in the political arena!

2024-05-02T13:02:30Z,UC675NhQ4EU5TzwCMwYp5XCw,Elon Musk Just FIRED Tesla's Charging Team. What NOW?,"Tesla's Supercharger Network has long been viewed as a pinnacle of EV fast charging by many in the automotive industry. In Europe, Superchargers are an important part of the wider EV charging landscape (thanks to the fact that all EVs in Europe use CCS Type 2 charging connectors). 

In the U.S. and Canada, Tesla's Supercharger network has outperformed CCS Type 1 in terms of reliability that most automakers are now planning on moving away from CCS toward NACS (SAE J3400). 

But exactly as that transition has begun, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has just fired the entirety of Tesla's Charging team, leaving rival automakers in the dark, customers questioning what's happening, and significant uncertainty over the future of Tesla's cooperation. 

So what's going on? What do we know? And what's still up in the air?

2020-10-29T18:30:40Z,UCuF49lP5gkkw5L8HK3H6GJg,The Story of Elon Musk,"Elon Musk is a business magnate, entrepreneur and engineer, who despite coming from humble beginnings in South Africa, is slowly becoming the individual most trusted with the future of human existence. But it's safe to say - It hasn't been all smooth sailing for Elon Musk. From sleeping on a couch in his first office, to 3 divorces, to 2 days from bankruptcy in 2008, it's certainly been a bumpy ride for the Neuralink, Tesla and SapceX CEO. Joe Rogan, the first planned trip to Mars, as well as outrageous goals to stop traffic as it is, are just 3 things we will discuss in this video. This, is the story of Elon Musk.
