In this first part of two episodes, Frank and Ian work through the early days of Amazon and find dozens of parallel lessons for any ambitious person looking to build a career.

""The Everything Store"" is a fascinating look into an American business icon and we break down every juicy bit in this two-part series.

A beacon in social entrepreneurship, CNN commentator, co-founder of Reform, and an advocate for justice and empowerment, Van Jones dives deep into his journey of creating substantial change in society.

In 2021, Jeff Bezos awarded Van with the Courage and Civility Award, accompanied by a whopping $100 million grant. In his first on-camera interview about this grant, Van shares his visionary plans to invest in projects aimed at disrupting poverty, transforming the prison industry, and uplifting marginalized communities. From innovations like ""Beat The Block"" to strategic alliances with public figures such as JAY-Z, Meek Mill, and Prince, his endeavors shine a light on pathways out of systemic disenfranchisement and toward collective prosperity.

Apart from these ventures, Van's legacy includes pioneering projects like the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, Color of Change, Green For All, #YesWeCode, and more. His accolades range from the Lumiere Award to an Emmy, reflecting his dedication and drive. #vanjones #JeffBezos #politics #tech #business",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tjWeQ92_lag/default.jpg,Earn Your Leisure,none,,tjWeQ92_lag,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjWeQ92_lag,84.58333333333333,242355,5062,0,516

In this lively presentation Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO of Amazon.com discusses many of the technological advances that have enabled Amazon.com to be the ""earth's most customer centric company"". Bezos talks about Amazon's first 30 days of operation, shows the very first home page and explains how the existence of a little known book warehouse in Roseburg Oregon led to the decision to locate Amazon in Seattle. Since 1997, Amazon has spent $800 million on technology, more than it has spent on either warehousing or marketing. A self-proclaimed ""EECS-geek"", Bezos tells of technological advances that have not only enabled customers to find products, (and now at 28 million items), enabled products to find customers. Hear how Amazon developed ""real time personalization"", how the company performs ""active experiments"" and learn more about salad spinners than you could ever imagine. Also appearing is MIT alum Robert Frederick, Manager of Amazon Net Services. Frederick explains how these services enable other retail services to interact with Amazon. Hear how the company that ""runs on computer science"" plans for more technological advances in the future.

2024-04-16T12:00:39Z,UCGrHwk-y7ERaq7bCSjZYf1A,"Working With Jeff Bezos, Navigating Sexism at Amazon With Exit Interview’s Kristi Coulter","Ever wondered what it's like to work at Amazon? I mean, if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere, just like New York, right? It feels like after you’ve done time at Amazon, your meal ticket is punched, and you’ll have a cascade of job offers and great opportunities thereafter. But would you give your soul in exchange for a career at Amazon?

In this episode, I have Kristi Coulter, a brilliant author who wrote the book Exit Interview. She's also a writing professor and an editorial coach, so she helps people get their books into the world.

Exit Interview is about Kristi's experience of 12 years at Amazon corporate. It is an incisive, hilarious book, and as a woman reading it, I felt it was so needed in the literary world. We needed someone to voice what was happening on the inside in corporate employment. 

We get into the sexism and double standards she faced, her tumultuous attempts to advance up the Amazon career ladder, her relationship with ambition, her sobriety journey, and how she has both learned - and proven - that it is never too late to change in life. She also recounts how Amazon - and specifically, Jeff Bezos - responded to the famous New York Times expose of Amazon by Jodi Kantor (who also broke the Harvey Weinstein abuse scandal). You definitely don’t want to miss that story.

And by the way, the brutal culture Kristi experienced at work is not unique to Amazon, but is something people from many in tech can relate to, so I found it cathartic to read.

So, if you’re wondering, ""Oh, Amazon, what's it like there?"" join us as we peel back the mystique and aura of Amazon. Don’t worry, we’ll get some solid and entertaining Jeff Bezos anecdotes up in there.

""I know there's this myth that people who make that kind of money aren't really working. But I could tell you, at Amazon, those people were working insanely hard. Like so hard that I would think, you know, you're worth tens of millions of dollars, why are you answering emails on Sunday night? … Why don't you go on more vacations? Like you have so much money. Right. I was like, give me that money, and I will show you how it's done.""

But its visionary founder, Jeff Bezos, wasn't content with being a bookseller. He wanted Amazon to become the everything store, offering limitless selection and seductive convenience at disruptively low prices. To do so, he developed a corporate culture of relentless ambition and secrecy that's never been cracked. Until now. Brad Stone enjoyed unprecedented access to current and former Amazon employees and Bezos family members, giving readers the first in-depth, fly-on-the-wall account of life at Amazon. Compared to tech's other elite innovators--Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg--Bezos is a private man. But he stands out for his restless pursuit of new markets, leading Amazon into risky new ventures like the Kindle and cloud computing, and transforming retail in the same way Henry Ford revolutionized manufacturing.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-qSxPKtNCio/default.jpg,Microsoft Research,none,,-qSxPKtNCio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qSxPKtNCio,61.95,3217,39,0,5

Niceland Seafood is the first turn-key provider of fresh Icelandic fish to offer full traceability from sea to pan. It’s the simple answer to the ever-growing problem with transparency in the fishing and seafood industries: Every Niceland Seafood package comes with a unique QR code that, once scanned, visualizes each individual journey from the fishing grounds to the store. Likewise, the system allows retailers to both purchase and track their orders in real time, all from their smartphone.

Prior to Flexport, Dave began his career at Amazon in 1999 as an Operations Manager, working his way up to become the CEO of Amazon’s worldwide consumer business in 2021. By the time Dave left, he was responsible for over 1 million employees. Dave spearheaded the launch of Amazon Robotics and grew the company’s logistics divisions to include Amazon’s own planes, trailers, and last-mile delivery vehicles through Amazon’s own delivery network (which today ships more packages than FedEx and UPS).

This is Jeff Bezos's first ever appearance before Congress. He started with, ""My mom, Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque, New Mexico. "" 

""My dad’s name is Miguel. He adopted me when I was four years old. He was 16 when he came to the United States from Cuba as part of Operation Pedro Pan, shortly after Castro took over. My dad arrived in America alone. His parents felt he’d be safer here. His mom imagined America would be cold, so she made him a jacket sewn entirely out of cleaning cloths, the only material they had on hand. We still have that jacket; it hangs in my parents’ dining room.""

Learn more about Jeff Bezos' story and purchase The Everything Store.

The book, The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon, applies whether you're an entrepreneur now, or dreaming of bigger things in the future. 

As you read the book, you might notice that Bezos was very aggressive, maybe to a fault at points, but it made him who he was.

At his 2010 Princeton commencement speech, he said, ""In the end, we are our choices.""

He took the path less trod upon, and he was so much happier for it.

You can listen to this interview on my podcast.

In addition, he also announced the Blue Moon lunar lander, which is capable of taking people and payloads to the lunar surface. Below you’ll find more information about these announcements.
 
Blue Moon lunar lander: Blue Origin announced Blue Moon, its large lunar lander capable of delivering multiple metric tons of payload to the lunar surface based on configuration and mission. The cargo variant revealed today can carry 3.6 metric tons to the surface. We have also designed a variant of the lander that can stretch to be capable of carrying a 6.5-metric-ton, human-rated ascent stage. Blue also announced it can meet the current Administration's goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar lander. 
 
BE-7 engine: The Blue Moon lunar lander will be powered by the BE-7 engine, a new addition to Blue Origin’s family of engines. The BE-7’s 40 kN (10,000 lbf) thrust is designed for large lunar payload transport. The engine’s propellants are a highly-efficient combination of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The BE-7 will have its first hotfire this summer. The engine will be available for sale to other companies for use in in-space and lander applications.
 
Club For the Future: A non-profit founded by Blue Origin dedicated to inspiring and engaging the next generation of dreamers and space entrepreneurs as we journey to preserve Earth and unlock the potential of living and working in space. The Club will bring together K-12 students, educators and leaders for campaigns and initiatives utilizing Blue Origin’s unique access to space. The Club’s first activity will be to send a postcard to space and back on a future New Shepard mission—the first ever space mail. Learn more on the website (www.clubforfuture.org).

After Mike had received his degree from the University of New Mexico, the family moved to Houston, Texas, so that he could begin working as an engineer for Exxon.[22] Jeff Bezos attended a Montessori school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he was two years old.[23] Jeff Bezos attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.[24] Bezos' maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.[25] Gise retired early to his family's ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Bezos would spend many summers in his youth.[26] Bezos would later purchase this ranch and expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117 ha) to 300,000 acres (121,406 ha).[27][28] Bezos displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency, and once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room.[29][30] The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Bezos attended Miami Palmetto High School.[31][32] While Bezos was in high school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift.[33]

Bezos attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,[34][35] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[34] In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention ""to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park"".[36] In 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a 4.2 GPA and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree (B.S.E.) in electrical engineering and computer science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[37][38] While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of the Quadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[39] In addition, he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS).[40]

2020-11-29T11:00:02Z,UCKxnwP0BVxYR--YMflNCtfQ,Jeff Bezos interview on Starting Amazon 2001,"In 1994, Jeff Bezos was a 30-year-old vice president of a New York investment firm, newly married, with a secure and prosperous future ahead of him. He decided to give it all up and drive to Seattle with his wife, in a used car, to start a business in their garage. He was betting his own savings — and his parents’ and friends’ — on a totally untried notion: that people would buy books through a little-known network of computers called the Internet.

Jeff Bezos was convinced that this global network, primarily the domain of academics and government scientists, could become a vibrant new venue for commerce, with the right product and the right plan. Almost overnight, the company Bezos started, Amazon.com, changed the book-buying habits of a nation. Bezos and his investors found their shares in the company worth billions.

As the company’s capitalization soared, Bezos embarked on a risky strategy of expansion, forgoing immediate profits to secure an ever-larger share of the Internet market, not only in books, but in music, videos, electronics, toys and clothing. At the turn of the 21st century, the Internet bubble burst, and fortunes seemingly made overnight literally vanished. Yet Amazon flowed on like its mighty namesake, still expanding, but also showing profits, while other promising start-ups faded from the scene. Once-daunting competitors had become grateful partners.

In 1994, Jeff Bezos was a 30-year-old vice president of a New York investment firm, newly married, with a secure and prosperous future ahead of him. He decided to give it all up and drive to Seattle with his wife, in a used car, to start a business in their garage. He was betting his own savings — and his parents’ and friends’ — on a totally untried notion: that people would buy books through a little-known network of computers called the Internet.

Jeff Bezos was convinced that this global network, primarily the domain of academics and government scientists, could become a vibrant new venue for commerce, with the right product and the right plan. Almost overnight, the company Bezos started, Amazon.com, changed the book-buying habits of a nation. Bezos and his investors found their shares in the company worth billions.

As the company’s capitalization soared, Bezos embarked on a risky strategy of expansion, forgoing immediate profits to secure an ever-larger share of the Internet market, not only in books, but in music, videos, electronics, toys and clothing. At the turn of the 21st century, the Internet bubble burst, and fortunes seemingly made overnight literally vanished. Yet Amazon flowed on like its mighty namesake, still expanding, but also showing profits, while other promising start-ups faded from the scene. Once-daunting competitors had become grateful partners. The vision of Jeff Bezos had prevailed, and the world of commerce had changed forever.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p7FgXSoqfnI/default.jpg,Manufacturing Intellect,none,,p7FgXSoqfnI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7FgXSoqfnI,47.46666666666667,134710,2412,0,252

00:25 Congressman Jordan to Pichai: ""This is a simple question. Yes or no?"" After all, you supported the Clinton campaign in 2016. I wanna know from them if you're gonna repeat your behavior in 2020 exactly as you did then when you helped Joe Biden trying to win the ekection”.

05:03 Price hikes at Amazon! Representative Mary Gay Scanlon interviews Amazon boss Jeff Bezos as a fierce argument breaks out between Congressman Jordan and committee chairman Cicilline. A loud argument erupts before the questioning can continue. Congressman Mary Gay Scanlon asks Jeff Bezos about Amazon's influence on www.Diapers.com Bezos is accused of using aggressive methods of influence in the diaper market. The diapers product is a competitive market that is very large.  Medium-sized families are severely affected by the price hikes.
11:02 Congressman Joe Neguse asks Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg about competitors that have disappeared from the market since the creation of Facebook (2004). It's about Facebook's monopoly and the methods Facebook uses to wipe out its competitors. Instagram is used as an example. Will Facebook ever try to buy Google?
16:36 Congresswoman Lucy McBath asks Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, why does Amazon intimidate its partners?

34:06 Congressman Pramila Jayapal interviews Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. The Congresswoman says Facebook is simply copying ideas from competitors.

In this episode, Ann shares the story of how she landed the job supporting Jeff Bezos at Amazon (after a 9 month interview process), the time she booked a helicopter for Bezos that ended up crashing, and what it was like growing in her career while working at Amazon in the “early” days. 

But Ann’s story doesn’t end at Amazon, and neither does our conversation. We chat about Ann’s time working closely with Marissa Mayer and Eric Schmidt at Google – and what she learned about leadership, goal setting (OKRs and KPIs), and managing a team. 

Lastly, Ann talks about why she wrote her book Bet on Yourself: Recognize, Own, and Implement Breakthrough Opportunities, in which she shares insights on what she learned from her time supporting tech titans.

The events surrounding the divorce of Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott in early 2019 were almost too far-fetched to believe. A day after they announced the dissolution of their 25-year marriage with a tweet, the National Enquirer published an explosive story, detailing Bezos’s extramarital relationship. Reporter Brad Stone tells the dramatic story of Bezos’s evolving personal life and its impact on the tech giant he founded — leading to his ultimate decision to step back from the role of CEO.

Foundering is an award-winning, serialized podcast from the journalists at Bloomberg Technology. Each season, Foundering brings you inside a different high-stakes drama from the technology industry, where its companies are wielding unprecedented capital and power.

Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has become the richest man in the world. Every second Euro in online trading is spent at Amazon. Is the IT giant, with its unabated growth, about to turn our economic system upside down?

Amazon is a machine that can simultaneously observe, compare and analyze more than 300 million people worldwide. The company is not just a marketplace, market supervisor and provider of more and more services and consumer items - it also controls all the data streams in this market and uses them to its own benefit. Who suspects that a single click on an Amazon page will forward information to the company that fills a printed DIN-A-4 page? A conversation with Alexa, watching a streaming offer on Amazon-Prime, ordering vegetables via Amazon-Fresh - all this put together creates a whole library of information about every customer. The group collects everything - it just won’t reveal what conclusions it draws from it. What would be possible if data from other, new business areas were added? In the USA, Amazon is also active in the health and insurance sectors, and police officers are using its facial recognition software to search for wanted persons.

2013-10-31T00:24:17Z,UCbmNph6atAoGfqLoCL_duAg,The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon | Brad Stone | Talks at Google`,"THE EVERYTHING STORE  is the definitive story of Amazon.com, one of the most successful companies in the world, and of its driven, brilliant founder, Jeff Bezos.

Amazon.com started off delivering books through the mail. But its visionary founder, Jeff Bezos, wasn't content with being a bookseller. He wanted Amazon to become the everything store, offering limitless selection and seductive convenience at disruptively low prices. To do so, he developed a corporate culture of relentless ambition and secrecy that's never been cracked. Until now. Brad Stone enjoyed unprecedented access to current and former Amazon employees and Bezos family members, giving readers the first in-depth, fly-on-the-wall account of life at Amazon.

According to Walter Isaacson, author of Steve Jobs, ""Jeff Bezos is one of the most visionary, focused, and tenacious innovators of our era, and like Steve Jobs he transforms and invents industries. Brad Stone captures his passion and brilliance in this well-reported and compelling narrative.""

2023-01-06T13:41:55Z,UCv_HbZMXAlgoF3DqkQG95qQ,An Interview with Steve Anderson: Author of The Bezos Letters,"Jeff Bezos is the world's richest entrepreneur, having built Amazon, the world's fastest company to reach $100 billion in revenue. Many business owners are still perplexed by Amazon's meteoric ascent, unsure of what the secret sauce is. However, now is the time to start looking for a solution, as Steve has brought you the roadmap to it.

Through his book, The Bezos Letters: 14 Principles To Grow Your Business Like Amazon, Steve Anderson, a business expert, discloses for the first time, the essential lessons, attitudes, concepts, and procedures that Bezos used to turn Amazon into the massive success it is today. He tries to tell business owners, executives, and CEOs how to take the same approach to their companies and become “more effective, productive, and profitable” in a short amount of time.

Steve Anderson is a trusted authority on Risk, Technology, Productivity, and Innovation with over 35 years of experience in the insurance sector. He is an Insurance Law master's degree holder. A sought-after speaker, author, and “futurist” also became one of the first 150 LinkedIn Influencers, with a large number of followers.

Steve discusses his lengthy research as well as the inspiration for creating The Bezos Letters with Matthew and Luigi in this episode of The Liquid Lunch Project. They also look at Bezos’ essential “growth principles,” that both major firms and “solopreneurs” may use to scale up.“I believe they can be applied to almost any organization,” Steve claims, “In fact, I've had feedback from nonprofits and others who aren't in the conventional corporate sector on how they have found the concepts to be useful.” Listen in to find out more.


What You Will Learn:

➡    What drove Steve to pen The Bezos Letters. 

➡    What turns out to be his favorite out of all the principles he discusses in the book. 

➡    How Steve's wife aided him in his efforts to write the book. 

➡    What some of Amazon's past missteps have been. 

➡    Why Steve believes that risk and business growth are inextricably linked. And much more!

Favorite Quote:

“One of my growth philosophies is to take risks with large ideas and to practice dynamic invention and innovation.”

John tells us why he decided to switch from Apple, just two months before the launch of the iPhone X, and why he's already regretting it - this is more than just another ""Apple v Android"" war of words though - there's some real business lessons in there.

This month's book of the month was ""The Everything Store"" by Brad Stone, which looks at the meteoric rise of Jeff Bezos, and Amazon.com, which leads John to the conclusion that ""he's a bit of an evil b*****d really isn't he?""

Jason once again tells us how simple running a successful business is - and it all comes down to doing ""what you say you're going to do.""

John shares some of his strategies for curing overwhelm (""getting rid of your phone"" is one of them, though that may simply related to his Samsung woes this month)

John also tells us what he learnt meeting Charlie Mullins, the ""millionaire plumber"" from Pimlico Plumbers last month.

For its first programme of the new century, 60 Minutes takes viewers on an astounding journey into the future. The guides will include sci-fi visionary, Arthur C. Clarke, Internet guru Jeff Bezos, President of the United States Bill Clinton, NSW Premier Bob Carr, author and futurist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki, NASA’s chief scientist Dennis Bushnell and business forecaster Phil Ruthven. With their help, 60 Minutes leaps into a world of 150 year-olds with the faces and bodies of 25-year-olds, into a world where bodies grow their own spare parts, where space becomes a desirable address, where planes seat 800 people and fly Sydney to London at twice the speed of sound while family cars sprout wings too. We hear predictions of beds that will calculate how long we need to sleep, of fridges that order our groceries and our looming battle to stave off environmental disaster.

2019-03-29T20:00:02Z,UC6ms9lq2XRrgdy0rOrMYVUQ,Jeff Bezos and What Drives Him,"This episode of the Self Development With Tactics / SDWT podcast is about an article on Jeff Bezos which I found on the Business Insider Nordic website from the 28th April 2018 so basically quite a year ago. This was some kind of an interview and Bezos gave it because he actually received the Axel Springer award in Berlin or at least  interview was in  Berlin. There he was talking to Mathias Döpfner  the CEO of Alex Springer. It was quite an interesting start of the  interview,  it gave a few insides of Jeff Bezos upcoming and why his grandfather is such an incredible important person for him.  additionally to that Bezos speaks about what drives him and what actually made him kind of pursuing his streams,  which was quite interesting.

 I hope you're getting something out of it and I'm seeing whether I'm just going to do such kind of interviews or articles in general or if I'm going to do it in a different way or if I'm just still just keeping to go through book summaries.

I as always hope that you get a lot out of that!

WHAT WOULD BEZOS DO: Steve Anderson is the quintessential business Risk and Growth Expert. And a healthy business is one that can, and does, take care of its people. Just like a business, recovery from a mental health problem or illness requires a degree of healthy risk. That’s why mental health expert Peter Diaz decided to pick Steve Anderson’s brain; this will help us learn to seek and use risk to our advantage. In this interview Steve, the author of international bestseller ‘The Bezos Letters: 14 Principles to Grow Your Business Like Amazon’ explains how to embrace risk as a key to growth and thriving. Key elements also required for a healthy mind. Risk & Growth Expert Steve Anderson shows business owners, executives, and leaders how to apply Bezos’ same practices to watch their business become more efficient, productive, and successful—fast!

Steve Anderson draws on a life time of experience in the insurance industry. Steve’s authority on risk is proven by his hundreds of thousands of followers and by the fact that Steve is recognised by LinkedIn as one of the world’s most influential thought leaders.

In this interview, Steve Anderson explains the principles that allowed Jeff Bezos to create Amazon, one of the world’s most valuable companies and, in the process, became the world’s richest person. Amazon was the fastest company to reach $100 billion in sales ever. And, he started by selling books online.

2024-03-11T15:53:50Z,UCLe0sykRt5eKIGYEnWzqWxQ,I figured out why Jeff Bezos is so successful | Jeff Bezos & Lex Fridman Podcast Review,"Today, we're delving into an exclusive interview featuring none other than Jeff Bezos, the visionary behind Amazon. This podcast took place approximately 2 months ago when Lex Friedman conducted an in-depth conversation with Jeff Bezos. During the interview, Bezos discussed various topics including the Amazon empire, Blue Origin, his family, and his wealth. Often, we absorb knowledge effortlessly, yet applying it to our own lives can be challenging due to the differing perspectives of the speaker and the listener. This disconnect can cause us to overlook important details. That's why I find it beneficial to pause, rewind, and analyze.

2022-11-16T05:29:23Z,UCpnwgg9U5Ds2E8yGQN8m7-w,Amazon Jeff Bezos says he will give most of his money to charity,"Amazon Jeff Bezos says he will give most of his money to charity

The Amazon founder, estimated to be worth $124 billion, suggested in an interview on CNN that he would donate most of his money to charity

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he will give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime, becoming the latest billionaire to pledge to donate much of his vast fortune.

Bezos, whose “real-time” worth Forbes magazine estimates at roughly $124.1 billion, made the announcement in a joint CNN interview with his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez that was released on Monday. The billionaire didn’t specify how - or to whom - he will give away the money, but said the couple were building the “capacity” to do it.

“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” Bezos said during the interview. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work and very smart teammates. And I’m finding - and Lauren’s finding - that philanthropy is very similar. It’s not easy. It’s really hard.”

Bezos had been criticized in the past for not signing the Giving Pledge, the campaign launched by Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffet to encourage billionaires to donate the majority of their wealth through philanthropy.

The Amazon founder, who has a net worth north of $124 billion, joins a growing list of billionaires who have made similar pledges

Bezos has a net worth of $124 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In an interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas, the world’s fourth-richest man said that he and his partner, Lauren Sanchez, were “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”

“And the hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said in the interview from his D.C. home. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that philanthropy is very similar.”

Bezos made much of his fortune by founding and running e-commerce giant Amazon, which he started in late 1994. He stepped down as CEO of the company last year but remains executive chair of its board. He also owns The Washington Post and Blue Origin, a rocket company.

Amazon plans to cut thousands of jobs, report says

Bezos has been criticized in the past for not signing the Giving Pledge, a movement that requires signatories to give away most of their wealth during their lifetimes or in their wills. Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Bill Gates and Bezos’s ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, have all signed it.

Bezos did not say during the interview whether he planned to sign the pledge.

Scott, who was married to Bezos for 25 years before they divorced in 2019, has become a prominent philanthropist. Two days after Bezos’s CNN interview, Scott said she had given almost $2 billion in donations over the past seven months. The money went to 343 organizations that help “people from underserved communities,” Scott wrote in a Monday blog post that listed all the groups. It’s the second philanthropic announcement this year from Scott, following news in March that she had given $3.8 billion to 465 nonprofits over the previous nine months.

He will remain the Executive Chair of the board while Andy Jassy will take over as Amazon CEO. BOOM's Govindraj Ethiraj interviews Haresh Chawla, Partner, True North and Sharad Sharma, Co-Founder, iSPIRT on the ramifications of this move on the e-commerce industry and the right time to transition in such situations through an Indian lens.

Haresh Chawla says that Amazon has now become a well-oiled machine of its own. Founders look for successors who can carry the DNA of the brand forward. It is noteworthy that Andy Jassy is construed as a person who is like Amazon - aggressive, focused, willingness to make mistakes and the willingness to embrace failure. 

Sharad Sharma says that companies grow in innings. This move most likely means a break-up of Amazon. Regulatory pressures are high and Jeff Bezos resigning will allow them to restructure the business. The Cloud and the retail business are fundamentally different businesses and Andy Jassy managed to integrate thinking about commerce when thinking about non finished goods.

Jeff Bezos came from adversity with his father being an 16 year-old immigrant from Cuba & his mother having him when she was 17. He did not grow up rich but had a great & supporting family. At the of 30 he decided to quit his well-payed & secure job & found Amazon. The little operation for selling books online, with great struggle raised 1 million dollars from 20 investors for 20% of the company. Just 5 years later its stock price first skyrocketed over 62 times only to plummet over 92% in the burst of the tech-bubble. From then on with a great focus, unchallenged long-term thinking, obsession for the customer & strive for experimenting & innovation, Jeff Bezos leads Amazon to be the second US public company to reach 1 trillion market capitalization & has over 180 billion in annual revenue!

3 Questions Jeff Bezos Asks Before Hiring Someone for Amazon | Everyone Should Consider These

If you’re a regular viewer of the Millionaire Secrets podcast, then you probably enjoyed the interview I did with Karen & Steve Anderson. They wrote a book called The Bezos Letters - all about the philosophies and systems of Jeff Bezos in his early days of building Amazon

In today’s Livestream, I’m going to be covering 3 of the key questions that Jeff Bezos asks before hiring someone for Amazon. Of course, in 2020 Jeff is no longer in the role of hiring people personally but he still holds his HR teams to the same standard.

More importantly, we’re going to be applying Jeff’s hiring standards to our own personal philosophies as entrepreneurs. For instance, what are 3 things you can ask yourself about your own skills? Is there really such a big difference between working for others versus working for yourself?

2018-05-26T12:07:50Z,UCw0uQHve23oMWgQcTTpgQsQ,14 Leadership Principles at Amazon via Jeff Bezos,"Coaching and Training:  https://bestofmany.com/

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job"". 

Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here"". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 

Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

As Americans gear up for the holiday season, he urged small businesses and individuals that if they intended to spend on big-ticket items this holiday season, they should rather keep that plan on hold. So why is Bezos putting out such signals, especially when his platform aims at encouraging people to spend more? Well, the answer could be the potentials of a recession and also 4-decade high inflation that American are faced with. Remember this also comes at a time when Amazon itself has laid off over 10,000 employees. So, how should one be navigating these downturns? Is Bezos' warning not applicable to the Indian consumers or can it prepare is for a recession hit winter?

Amazon’s decision came after a 14-month search that saw cities around the U.S. promise tax breaks, taxpayer-funded infrastructure and business-friendly ordinances in an effort to win what Amazon says will be $5 billion in new investment and thousands of jobs. Democratic Virginia Governor Ralph Northam called the Amazon headquarter “a big win for Virginia,” and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has similarly applauded Amazon’s decision. But many local politicians have openly criticized authorities in New York and Virginia for backing the deals, which will create a total of 50,000 jobs. We host a roundtable discussion about Amazon and corporate welfare. In New York, we speak with Ron Kim, member of the New York State Assembly. He recently co-wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times headlined “New York Should Say No to Amazon.” In Washington, D.C., we speak with Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a watchdog group on economic development incentives. And in Portland, Maine, we speak with Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. She is the author of “Big-Box Swindle: The True Cost of Mega-Retailers and the Fight for America’s Independent Businesses.”

Bezos founded Amazon.com in 1994 as an online bookstore.

2017-05-23T20:12:38Z,UCw0uQHve23oMWgQcTTpgQsQ,Amazon's 14 Leadership Principles via Jeff Bezos,"Coaching and Training:  https://bestofmany.com/

00:00 1. Customer obsession: start with the customer and work backwards; work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust; pay attention to competitors, but keep obsessing over customers
2. Ownership: think like an owner, long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results; act on behalf of the entire company, not just for your own team; never say “that’s not my job""
3. Invent and simplify: expect and require innovation and invention from your team and always find ways to simplify; be externally aware, always look for new ideas from everywhere, and don’t be limited by “not invented here""
4. Leaders are right a lot 1:52 : you have strong judgment and good instincts; you seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm your beliefs
5. Frugality 3:50 : accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense
6. Hire and develop the best 5:01 : raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion; recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization; develop leaders and take seriously your role in coaching others
7. Earn trust 5:05 : listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. Be vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing; leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume; benchmark yourself and your team against the best.
8. Insist on the highest standards 7:42 : you have relentlessly high standards - many may think these standards are unreasonably high; you are continually raising the bar and driving your team to deliver high quality products, services and processes; defects do not get sent down the line and problems are fixed so they stay fixed
9. Bias for action 11:34 : speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
10. Learn and be curious 11:34 : you are never done learning and you always seek to improve; you are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them
11. Have backbone. Disagree and commit 13:26 : respectfully challenge decisions when you disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting; have conviction and be tenacious; do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion; once a decision is determined, commit to it.
12. Dive deep 13:26 : operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and be skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath you.
13. Think big 16:04 : thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. Think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
14. Deliver results 16:04 : focus on the key inputs for your business and deliver with the right quality and in a timely fashion; despite setbacks, rise to the occasion and never settle",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B-xdfQv3I1k/default.jpg,Dan Croitor,none,,B-xdfQv3I1k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-xdfQv3I1k,20.35,1105188,12314,0,234
