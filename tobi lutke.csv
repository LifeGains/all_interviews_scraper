Show notes: https://tim.blog/2019/02/07/tobi-lutke-shopify/
The Tim Ferriss Show podcast: https://tim.blog/podcast 

Start [00:00]
How far back does Tobi‚Äôs obsession for optimization go? [05:58]
How big is Shopify today? [08:14]
How did Tobi and I first meet? [09:13]
From my perspective, Shopify is a living example of what happens when the good guys win. [11:45]
Did Tobi‚Äôs early authority problems lay the groundwork for his current success? [12:31]
Something Tobi and Seth Godin agree on: the current characteristics of a temporary solution shouldn‚Äôt be mistaken as the ultimate objective. [18:57]
Even though you probably didn‚Äôt learn about him in history class, here‚Äôs how entrepreneur Malcolm McLean changed the world. [20:25]
A few of the books Tobi has found indispensable for finding footing in the business world. [23:13]
As a self-described slow reader with dyslexia, Tobi has to be selective with the books he takes in. By what criteria does a book make it to Tobi‚Äôs ‚Äúto read‚Äù list? [26:55]
How Tobi‚Äôs role at Shopify changed from passionate programmer to reluctant CEO, and how he rose to the challenge to crash course his way through the learning process. [29:50]
When pitching to VCs on Sand Hill Road, this is how Tobi rolls (literally). [36:05]
Good and bad decisions Tobi made as a fledgling CEO. [37:36]
As a man whose expectations for employees match what he expects from himself, is Tobi difficult to work for? [39:31]
How does Shopify company culture facilitate the thick skin required to abide by Crocker‚Äôs Rules? [44:12]
Feedback is a gift. [47:37]
How the Enneagram system is used at Shopify as an empathy exercise rather than a personal horoscope. [48:56]
How can a growth (versus fixed) mindset ‚Äî per psychologist Carol Dweck‚Äôs work ‚Äî be fostered? [50:30]
Tobi‚Äôs definition of Hell. [55:24]
How Scott Adams‚Äô ‚Äútalent stacking‚Äù applies to Tobi‚Äôs career trajectory. [58:03]
Tobi addresses the factors that contribute to an underreported entrepreneurship crisis. [1:03:08]
How Shopify‚Äôs annual Build a Business competition came about, what it aims to accomplish, and some of the hurdles it has faced along the way. [1:08:39]
The first Build a Business winner and how its success was boosted by a happenstance presidential endorsement. [1:15:43]
The fascinating patterns, principles, and stories we observe every year when Build a Business time comes around. [1:17:39]
Does dyslexia affect Tobi‚Äôs coding? [1:23:49]
In search of an extended sense of peace? Here‚Äôs a book recommendation. [1:24:12]
What Tobi means by ‚Äúthe next box.‚Äù [1:25:59]
What Tobi learned about the next box from J√ºrgen, his mentor. [1:30:18]
Is it possible to understand the box you currently occupy and aim for the box you want to occupy next? [1:33:37]
In what box does Tobi see himself at the moment? [1:34:37]
How does Tobi choose ways to stress test possible exits from his current box? [1:35:38]
We examine the reasons behind Tobi‚Äôs discomfort with comfort on a business level in spite of generally considering himself ‚Äúthe most fortunate person on the planet‚Äù on a personal level. [1:36:50]
On identifying himself as the bottleneck that held back Shopify for a period of time, what caused this, and what Tobi is doing to ensure he doesn‚Äôt take on this unenviable role again. [1:40:21]
Why does Tobi think the business not only survived this period in the bottleneck, but actually began to thrive? [1:42:35]
Increasing ‚Äúluck surface area‚Äù and staying in touch with the front lines by getting in the trenches from time to time. [1:47:44]
How Shopify‚Äôs chief investor from the early days still helps Tobi focus on what‚Äôs important ‚Äî by ensuring he‚Äôs not ‚Äúmeddling‚Äù in minutiae. [1:49:13]
Though the future is admittedly uncertain, here are two things Tobi believes a forward-looking CEO can do to peek into what seems most probable. [1:51:54]
Is modern China showing us tomorrow today? [1:54:05]
What can the massively successful but mostly ignored video game industry teach the business world about the human psyche? [1:55:00]
What would Tobi‚Äôs billboard say? [1:57:18]
What books does Tobi most frequently gift? [1:57:49]
What is the Adlerian separation of tasks? [2:00:01]
Why Tobi believes we, as a society, need to celebrate and support entrepreneurship now more than ever. [2:00:52]
What cities does The Oracle of Ottawa believe are doing the best job of taking business into the future? [2:03:00]
Parting thoughts. [2:04:32]",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PQRXssjlk9U/default.jpg,Tim Ferriss,none,,PQRXssjlk9U,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQRXssjlk9U,132.5,119669,1254,0,116,0.0,tobi lutke
2020-08-10T16:09:18Z,UCfhjU8_QS4KhnmBXc7VI5AQ,How to Land Your Dream Job & Become The Best Version of Yourself with Tobi Oluwole!,"Welcome to The Generation Hustle Podcast! A show that explores the world of business, entrepreneurship, and culture all centered around the millennial.

In episode 7, we speak with Tobi Oluwole!

Tobi is the CEO of The3Skills, a company founded on the mission to develop the most marketable people in the world by equipping them with the skills they need to understand and communicate their true value. He also works as Merchant Success Manager at Shopify.

At 15 years old, Tobi came to Canada to attend an international high school and quickly realized how big of a minefield unemployment is for this demographic of graduates. Driven by the struggles of his sister and friends to land jobs, he posted a simple message on LinkedIn:

‚ÄúI want to help 5 people get jobs this year.""

He received 50 messages. The idea for 3Skills was born. In one year, they helped 36 people land full time roles with a combined income of over $1.7M.

Today, the company has expanded to offer various courses, group coaching, and a referral program from a vast network of partners.

We talk to Tobi about his journey to Canada, building this company, how he landed his dream job in just 12 days, and becoming the best version of yourself.

We hope this conversation inspires you as much as it did us!

Before that, he started and sold two companies - Ximian and Xamarin. He is also the founder of AI Grant and California YIMBY.

And most recently, he has created and funded the Vesuvius Challenge - a million dollar prize for reading an unopened Herculaneum scroll for the very first time. If we can uncover these scrolls, we may be able to recover lost gospels, forgotten epics, and missing works of Aristotle.

We also discuss the future of open source and AI, running Github and building Copilot, and why EMH is a lie.

2022-03-18T19:31:06Z,UC7nJSThQ5J3l-WIuTtHLLwg,Founders of Vail: Rod Slifer in conversation with Terry Minger,"In a state as young as Colorado, the town of Vail is especially new having only been incorporated in 1966. Few people get the opportunity to found and shape a new community: Colorado native Rod Slifer is such a person. Prior to his arrival in Vail, Slifer was in Aspen, teaching skiing in the winter and painting homes in the summer. After interviewing with Pete Siebert in 1962, Slifer was offered a position at the fledgling Vail ski resort. Slifer handled whatever was thrown at him which would form the foundation of a life spent in service to his community.

His contributions to the community cannot be overstated. He served as a member of the Vail Town Council for 16 years and the mayor of Vail for 11 years. He was a founding director of Alpine Banks of Colorado, director of Colorado Open Lands, vice-chair of Vail Valley Foundation and is one of the founders of the University of Colorado Real Estate Center and Real Estate Foundation. Slifer was also an early member of Eagle County and Vail Planning Commissions and Recreation District. Presciently, he was the first real estate agent in Vail.

The Vail Symposium is honored to host an evening with one of the founders of Vail. Slifer will be in conversation with Terry Minger, a Vail legend in his own right. Hear the stories and meet the characters from two people who were there at the beginning.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RN4uoJDltYw/default.jpg,Vail Symposium,none,,RN4uoJDltYw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN4uoJDltYw,89.41666666666667,308,4,0,2,0.0,tobi lutke

We have been on a roll with our guests lately, and we are certainly not slowing down anytime soon. From there, we look at some of the headlines, such as CDIC developments and the myths around inflation. Next, we move onto to listener rapid-fire questions. Some of the topics include the difference between leveraged ETFs and traditional ones as well as a small-cap investment strategy for an investor with a 30-year plus investment timeline. We then turn our attention to the core topic of the show, dollar-cost averaging versus lump-sum investing. Ben presents an overview of dollar-cost averaging along with some of the perceived benefits. We dive into his analysis of dollar-cost averaging versus lump sum investing in equity portfolios over select 10-year periods across various countries. We discuss the results based on a range of factors and variables. The crux of the argument is that dollar-cost averaging is not as compelling as it‚Äôs often sold to be. While there are psychological benefits, the empirical evidence shows that there are not real ones. We wrap the show up with a look at how the pandemic is likely to shape the annuities industry and retirement planning. Tune in today!

Key Points From This Episode:

2021-02-11T22:02:57Z,UCAPoSaXFoRQYFrlWkvhsnQA,Entrepreneur's Dilemma: How Do You Find Your Technical Co-Founder?,"This new generation of entrepreneurs is steeped in industry experience. They are identifying real industry and social problems. They envision the solution but lack the skill to create the product. 

I interview two founders at opposite ends of the process. David is currently looking for a tech co-founder. Michael found his tech co-founder. Listen to these two founders tell you what they learned in solving this problem.

The SmartPM Story

Michael Pink is the founder, and CEO of SmartPM. Michael was a Deloitte consultant to the construction industry. He provided property owners and contractors the information they needed to settle disputes. Michael became an expert at analyzing complex construction projects and summarizing the data needed by all to move the projects forward. He got so good at it, he decided to start SmartPM and automate what he did manually. 

The problem was, he needed a technically focused partner to build the product long-term. He went on a long search and found the right person after spending $300k on outsourced versions of his product.

The M Cultivo Story

My son, David Paparelli worked in the coffee industry for the last eight years. He knows the industry from farm to retail. He created M Cultivo to help farmers internationally achieve a living wage through better pricing data. He‚Äôs identified the problem, created the MVP, and now he needs help building the product. He‚Äôs looking for the technical lead who will join him in achieving his vision.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4F8zouvfMp0/default.jpg,Paparelli,none,,4F8zouvfMp0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F8zouvfMp0,84.16666666666667,116,2,0,0,0.0,tobi lutke

Daniel and Tyler also discuss undervalued talents and skills, what talents they look for in the start-up and investment world, why there is no good chocolate ice cream to be found in San Fransico, what their exercise preferences indicate about their personalities, how they approach identifying talent in different countries and industries, how immigration impacts entrepreneurialism, the short-comings to Zoom interviews, what a messy desk reveals about a person, and more.

Die ganz fr√ºhen Stationen einmal im Zeitraffer: in den 80er Jahren in Koblenz aufgewachsen (‚Äûein Sch√§ngelkind‚Äú, wie er selbst sagt), fr√ºh angefangen, zu programmieren, die Schule nach der 10.

Nik, Moiz and Harley get into how Harley started his first business to support his mom and sisters and why practicing law is the antithesis of entrepreneurship. The pair also ask the tough questions raised by Limited Supply listeners on Shopify‚Äôs functionality.

You‚Äôll hear why strong partnerships are still a huge priority, how democratizing the entrepreneurial journey was just the start, and where Shopify‚Äôs ambitions are taking them.

And if you‚Äôre looking to create an app for your brand, you need Tapcart. Using a drag and drop builder makes it super easy and you can be up running in days, rather than weeks. You‚Äôll start seeing crazy high conversion rates and a push notification CTR that‚Äôs 7 X higher than email. Check out www.tapcart.com today.

2021-03-03T08:00:01Z,UCGTAq2MQb2DsQi2KTMi0Jgw,Secrets Of Success | Nick Shaw Interview,"What if I told you there was one weird trick to realize all of your biggest dreams?
 
Just one thing you could do to achieve success and live your best life.
 
Want to know what it is?
 
The trick is to ignore all the one weird tricks.
 
That‚Äôs right. The real secret isn‚Äôt shortcuts and fads. It‚Äôs hard work, consistency, discipline, and building good habits. That‚Äôs the real juice.
 
If I just knocked the wind out of your sails, I understand. 
 
Hard work sounds a lot less fun than instant gratification. But what‚Äôs more fun? Failing, jumping on the next bandwagon, and failing again, or making real progress and actually achieving what you want? In the long-run, the tried-and-true methods of developing a strong work ethic and discipline have an astounding track record and are far more likely to get you where you want to go. 
 
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about on this episode with Nick Shaw. He‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs learned these lessons and honed them through personal hardship, building them into an actionable framework in his book Fit For Success, that you can follow to live your best life.
 
If you‚Äôre not familiar with Nick, he‚Äôs the founder and CEO of Renaissance Periodization (co-founded by Dr. Mike Israetel, who‚Äôs also been on the podcast). He‚Äôs also a former competitive powerlifter and bodybuilder, who‚Äôs coached hordes of elite athletes, including CrossFit Games Champions, Olympians, UFC fighters, and professional athletes, so he knows a thing or two about achieving success and helping others do so.
 
In this episode, Nick and I chat about . . .
 
- Why he wrote Fit For Success
- Enjoying the work process versus being outcome-oriented
- Morning routines and the benefits of waking up early
- Mindfulness and the difference between using data instead of feelings
- Developing discipline and thinking long-term
- The importance of a positive mindset
- And more . . .
 
So if you‚Äôre ready to ditch the fads and nonsense and build positive habits that can improve your life, listen to this podcast!

0:00 - Intro
 
13:48 - What are the key concepts of success that you wrote in your book?
 
16:17 - What does hard work mean to you?
 
21:39 - Where are you now with work/life balance?
 
24:24 - What are your thoughts on developing work ethic?
 
25:57 - How do you organize your to-do list?
 
27:07 - Do you have a morning routine?
 
47:08 - What is your take on developing discipline?

Byron Deeter and Jeremy Levine from Bessemer Venture Partners brought together three resilient founders who built their startups during the immediate aftermath of The 2008 Recession. In this conversation, we talked to Jeff Lawson, CEO and co-founder of Twilio, Tobi L√ºtke, CEO and founder of Shopify, and Ben Silbermann, CEO and co-founder of Pinterest.

We covered topics, such as:
- Lessons learned from the ‚Äò08 Recession
- Building a company during a down market
- Gaining traction for the short and long term
- Building the skills and culture to weather difficult times

While no one can predict the future, we can reflect on the lessons we‚Äôve learned from past downturns to help founders navigate their path forward for the long term.

2021-06-24T18:40:44Z,UCWtLaglvDYaRXAA9vE2PBcg,Interview mit COKO - mit einer Shopify-App den CO2-Verbrauch von Fashion sichtbar machen.,"Ca. 65 Prozent aller Textilien auf dem Weltmarkt sind aus synthetischen Chemiefasern, also aus Kunststoffen wie Polyester, Polyamid oder Polyacryl. F√ºr ihre Produktion waren im Jahr 2015 98 Millionen Tonnen √ñl n√∂tig. Im Jahr 2050 sollen es sogar schon 300 Millionen Tonnen sein.

Mit diesem Verbrauch an fossilen Rohstoffen ist die Textindustrie zu einem der gr√∂√üten Klimas√ºnder weltweit geworden. Im Jahr 2015 wurden 1,2 Milliarden Tonnen CO2 durch die Produktion von Textilien emittiert. Das ist mehr CO2 als die internationalen Fl√ºge und die Schifffahrt zusammen verursachen. Tendenz steigend.

Das Problem ist, dass wir beim Kauf von Kleidung selten das Bewusstsein f√ºr dieses Problem haben. 

Die L√∂sung besteht aus der App von COKO. COKO hat f√ºr die Onlineshop-Plattform eine App entwickelt, die den CO2-Verbrauch pro Kleidungsst√ºck errechnet und im Shop des Verk√§ufers eine Kompensation anbietet, die dann an Umweltprojekte weitergeleitet wird.

F√ºr den Betrieb der App und f√ºr das Sammeln der Spenden, erh√§lt COKO eine Servicegeb√ºhr.

Wenn Ihr auch einen Online-Shop f√ºr Fashion bei Shopify betreibt und Euch das Gesch√§ftmodell gef√§llt, dann schaut doch mal bei https://coko-projects.de/ vorbei oder st√∂bert im Shopify-App-Store.

Since his early days running an online snowboard shop from his carport, Tobi has envisioned himself as fundamentally a craftsman first and a business exec second, a mindset that he has used to solve a wide variety of problems over the course of his career. In this episode, he joins Kevin to talk about applying computer science and engineering techniques to build and scale a company, the idea of bringing an ‚Äòapprentice mindset‚Äô to his work, and how his daily practice of writing code and tinkering in his home lab inspires him to be a more creative leader.

2018-12-07T17:00:20Z,UCznv7Vf9nBdJYvBagFdAHWw,Doug McMillon ‚Äî CEO of Walmart | The Tim Ferriss Show (Podcast),"Doug McMillon (IG: @dougmcmillon) is president and chief executive officer of Walmart, a company that, if it were a country, would be the 25th largest economy in the world. Walmart serves 265 million customers weekly in 27 countries across more than 11,000 stores and online, and the company employs roughly 2.2 million associates worldwide, which would equate to the second largest army in the world (behind China) if it were tasked with defending that 25th largest economy.

75 percent of Walmart‚Äôs store management team began as hourly associates, and Doug is no exception. He started out in 1984 as a summer associate in the Walmart distribution center, and in 1990 while pursuing his MBA, he rejoined the company as an assistant manager in Tulsa before moving to merchandising as a buyer trainee. He worked his way up, and from 2005 to 2009 he served as president and CEO of Sam‚Äôs Club (owned and operated by Walmart) with sales of more than $46 billion annually during his tenure.

From February of 2009 to 2014, Doug served as president and CEO of Walmart International, a fast-growing segment of Walmart‚Äôs overall operations. He has served on the board of directors for Walmart since 2013 and is currently the chair of the executive and global compensation committees. In addition, he serves on the board of directors of the Consumer Goods Forum, the US-China Business Council and Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. He also serves on the executive committee of the Business Roundtable and the advisory board of the Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management in Beijing, China.

This episode was recorded live at the Heartland Summit in Bentonville, AR, surrounded by the jaw-droppingly mind-blowing Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Please enjoy!

GitLab, on the other hand, is the world‚Äôs largest all-remote company, with over 1,300 team members in 65+ countries and years of experience in the remote world.

GitLab believes that remote work enables a more diverse and inclusive workforce, greater efficiency in workflows, and broader global coverage in servicing clients.

Now ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù retired, he lives with his wife in North Carolina.

In the early 2000s, founder Tobi Lutke was trying to sell snowboards online, but the barriers to entry were enormous. He created his own cloud-based software, and like a lot of entrepreneurs, ended up abandoning his original snowboard shop idea. He now has 60,000 companies that use Shopify as the backbone for their online retail operations. From Shopify's base in Ottawa, Canada, Jason talks to Tobi about the future of retail, why BestBuy will die, and his ambition to become one-stop-shopping for every interesting product, the stuff that doesn't come with a barcode. Plus, the story of his stunt recruitment day at IBM, as they announced layoffs at their Ottawa facility.

Highlights

1:15 Shopify is a huge company that has over 60,000 customers. And the company provides shopping services.
2:00 When did this company start?
2:22 So you were selling snowboards?
4:30 People were not charging for cloud-based software at that time (2004).
6:15 The one thing I've heard from people is you charge too little ($20-30/month to have a store).
9:15 My choice for the Audible book of the week in Flourish by Martin Seligman. http://audible.com/twist to get a free audiobook. And forward your subscription to audible@launch.co to be entered in our iPad mini contest (deadline August 15).
15:45 So 200 people right now, and you've raised some decent venture capital. Tell us about the size of the company today.
17:00 Commerce is going to change significantly. How do you think it's going to change?
18:55 So if I'm buying my Jambox from Jawbone, and I see it in a store, airport, or on my mobile phone, it's all the same back end: it's Shopify. Does that mean you're going to build a point of sale system?
20:50 When you saw Square's massive success doing point of sale, did you kick yourself?
21:31 You have same day delivery, mailboxes changing to package boxes, and you have Amazon's pickup locations (at 7-11, etc).
22:40 What do you think is going to happen to retail?
26:00 Thanks to Scott Ed Walker at Walker Corporate Law. He specializes in helping startups with years of experience and flat rate fees: scott@walkercorporatelaw.com
26:45 Experience + retail: Apple Store, Disney Store, Nespresso Store, Microsoft Stores. What do you think of the experiential retail concept?
28:40 What would you do if you were BestBuy?
30:00 Who's doing a good job? You mentioned LuluLemon.
30:30 So pop-up stores are the future?
31:30 So if Shopify were to have 10 retails locations in 10 cities, what would you do?
33:10 I would love to be able to go to a pop up store once a month and talk to the CEO about what their line is and why they made it.
36:50 What's the average size of a shop on Shopify? $100k per year? $1m per year?
39:30 How do you decide between going global and adding fun features?
41:40 People are addicted to the metrics, right?
42:44 The hardest part of the job?
45:30 Who's a bigger competitor - Amazon, Etsy, or Kickstarter?
48:50 This is a company that's worth $500m-$1b. Has that sunk in?

Shopify today has grown into a powerhouse today, and is responsible for the back-end of 8.5% of the online sales in the US.

This includes:

- what it's like as a recruiter in Canada
- how to prepare a resume and cover letter (and why you should include one)
- how to network from abroad and why it's so important
- crafting LinkedIn messages for effective networking

And much more!

This was part of a live Facebook video hosted in the private Visto group, which you can signup for free for at https://visto.ai/

About Marianne:

Marianne Encina is a Recruiter at Shopify and co-founder of The 3Skills (https://the3skills.com/), a company that supports international students on their journey to landing their first job. Marianne left Bolivia to move to Canada for university at the age 18, and like many other international students struggled to balance finding a job that qualified for permanent residency but that was also fulfilling and in her field.

Her career journey took her through the Banking industry as she moved up the corporate ladder to a Senior Financial Advisor role, transitioned into the tech world through a sales role in the education sector, and found a home at Shopify as a recruiter. Today, Marianne uses her relationship skills as a recruiter for Internal Operations and her love for building communities by running in-person and online Career Boot Camps with the 3Skills, whose goal is to level up the skills international students need to understand and communicate their true value.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FfibQCr_HD0/default.jpg,Visto,none,,FfibQCr_HD0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfibQCr_HD0,36.35,1392,18,0,4,0.0,tobi lutke

L√ºtke‚Äôs always been tech-savvy. In fact, he left school at age 16 for a programming apprenticeship. However, in his quest to build a 20-person lifestyle business, he never anticipated he‚Äôd be at the helm of a now publicly-traded company with nearly 5,000 employees. 

At Core Summit 2019 we dug into his initial hesitations to grow the company, their current aspirations, and how they managed to expand by embracing a then-unheard-of corporate culture. In this fireside chat, Tobi is joined by Shopify board member, Gail Goodman, and Underscore investor, Lily Lyman.

One of the biggest mistakes new photographers often make when they get into wedding photography is not charging enough for their services, and trying to compete with the established wedding photographers in their area on price.

Apart from the fact that ‚Äúpracticing‚Äù your wedding photography skills on real weddings is not a good idea, the key to success is that it‚Äôs all about the experience from the bride‚Äôs perspective, and that‚Äôs something that Vanessa focuses on a great deal with her clients.

If you want to make more money with wedding photography, with fewer clients, then creating a wonderful client experience is going to be a key factor in your success.

Here are some of the interesting topics Vanessa and I covered in this episode:

* How Vanessa got started in the wedding photography business‚Ä¶
* The advantages of understanding the nuances of film photography over digital‚Ä¶
* The top qualities of successful wedding photographers‚Ä¶
* The elements of a successful wedding photography business model‚Ä¶
* Why people who pay more for your services are actually easier to work with‚Ä¶
* Creating the boutique experience your wedding photography clients‚Ä¶
* Attracting the right kind of wedding clients for your photography business‚Ä¶
* The incredible power of creating a same-day wedding album‚Ä¶
* A look at Vanessa‚Äôs wedding workflow‚Ä¶
* Some advice on outsourcing tasks to improve productivity‚Ä¶
* Some of the top mistakes new wedding photographers are making‚Ä¶

2016-08-24T18:35:30Z,UChqY9VpTfzNrIxMIfjDKOmg,The Rise of Shopify - Tobias L√ºtke (Shopify) & Kara Swisher,"Startupfest 2016
Shopify's IPO showed the startup world that Canadian companies could achieve great things without leaving Canada. But it took years for the company to become the overnight success everyone's heard of. In this interview with founder Tobias L√ºtke, startup chronicler Kara Swisher finds out just how the company got there.

Startupfest is Canada's original startup event, bringing over 7000 founders, investors, accelerators, and community leaders from across the globe to Montreal, Canada every July. The event is one week of unbeatable networking, education, and parties in an iconic festival format. Learn more at startupfest.com

2021-05-26T16:19:01Z,UC4gD0czpXVv_LpADTSU624g,"Shopify SLAMS ""Woke"" Culture?! Shopify CEO Says Company is APOLITICAL!","Shopify CEO Tobias L√ºtke has issued a statement that the company is FOR PROFIT and should be APOLITICAL. This after Coinbase and Basecamp issued similar statements. After years of pandering to Twitter, will tech companies finally get a clue, or will anti-capitalist activists actively try to burn these companies down from within?

Here's what he said...

‚ÄúWe are trying to create a world class product that gives superpowers to the merchants that we are obsessed over,‚Äù L√ºtke wrote. ‚ÄúEverything Shopify does is to accomplish this, and everyone at Shopify should be able to describe how their job, through a series of direct or indirect steps, furthers this mission.‚Äù 

‚ÄúShopify, like any other for-profit company, is not a family,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThe very idea is preposterous. You are born into a family. You never choose it, and they can‚Äôt un-family you. The dangers of ‚Äòfamily thinking‚Äô are that it becomes incredibly hard to let poor performers go. Shopify is a team, not a family.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe cannot solve every societal problem here,‚Äù L√ºtke warns. ‚ÄúShopify‚Äôs worldview is well documented‚Äîwe believe in liberal values and equality of opportunity. Sometimes we see opportunities to help nudge these causes forward. We do this because this directly helps our business and our merchants and not because of some moralistic overreach.‚Äù

The CEO reiterated his commitment to a meritocracy-based employment system, driven by efficiency, not politics.

‚ÄúWe will always have compassion for team members in truly difficult situations‚Ä¶ [but] we need to remind everyone that like any other competitive (sports) team, it matters how you show up every day and contribute to the team‚Äôs success,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúBeyond straight performance output, everyone that engages in endless Slack trolling, victimhood thinking, us-vs-them divisiveness, and zero sum thinking must be seen for the threat they are: they break teams.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe want to build one of the best companies in the world,‚Äù L√ºtke concluded. ‚ÄúWe want everyone to have a shot at bettering their lot through entrepreneurship‚Ä¶ when we succeed in our mission, millions of merchants do better. Millions of people find employment. We have the opportunity to make that tens and even hundreds of millions in the future.‚Äù

2018-09-03T15:34:08Z,UCHyKw2eTvVOwnIGTCApFkKg,Probably the Most Impressive CEO I've Ever Interviewed! #249,"Today was action packed! I met with JJ Sussman at Meatos where we had a huge steak lunch and then attempted an interview through a meat-induced haze. After an impressive career in tech, JJ now heads up an organization called Gesher which seeks to help heal divisions in Israel and encourage good relations between Jews in Israel and the diaspora.


I then dashed off to i24 news for my weekly guest appearance where we talk about the week's tech news: Apple, Huawei, home gear fixing services and... heat!


I then went to ELAL but no camera so... off to WIX where I met with their always busy CEO, Avishai Avrahami. With 140 million users and 2600 employees, it was very gracious of him to meet with me. WIX is a great company and Avrahami had some great insights (""measure everything!""). Just another day in Startup Nation!

Thank you for checking out this episode of my vlog! 

I regularly post content that revolves around Israeli tech startups, with a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the brilliant minds behind the innovations. It's not for nothing that Israel has gone from being ""startup nation,"" to ""scale-up"" nation. Whether the products are hardware or software, or B2B's or B2C's, there is always much to learn from everyone- from the angel investors, to VC's, to CEO's, CMO's, sales/marketing professionals, developers, interns, and more. That's not all this vlog is about. You can also see all that Israel has to offer, from world-class restaurants, to gorgeous beaches, to scenic views, to ancient historical landmarks, and more. It's always fun for me to take out my drone and capture all the glory that Israel has to offer. What would you like to get a closer look of in the Israeli tech scene? Let me know in the comments, and I'll try to make it happen. Your feedback means a lot.

His company is based outside of a major tech hub (he lives in Boise, Idaho), he's bootstrapped his business to ~$1.2 MM in ARR, and he's as transparent as they come (putting all his financials up online for the world to see).

Find out how he's mastered growth by embracing unconventional wisdom ‚Äî and why one A/B test almost tanked his signup flow this past year.

Our conversation with Nathan covers the two inflection points that dramatically altered the course of ConvertKit, the decision behind switching to a credit card required sign-up flow, and how he's increased MRR using unusual tactics.
