The House of Representatives' Antitrust Subcommittee is investigating whether the power, size and tactics of the four companies has crushed competition, reduced innovation and harmed consumers.

It is the first time tech's most well-known bosses have appeared together in front of a committee and their performance could well decide whether US politicians decide to introduce new laws curbing Big Tech's power.

A beacon in social entrepreneurship, CNN commentator, co-founder of Reform, and an advocate for justice and empowerment, Van Jones dives deep into his journey of creating substantial change in society.

In 2021, Jeff Bezos awarded Van with the Courage and Civility Award, accompanied by a whopping $100 million grant. In his first on-camera interview about this grant, Van shares his visionary plans to invest in projects aimed at disrupting poverty, transforming the prison industry, and uplifting marginalized communities. From innovations like ""Beat The Block"" to strategic alliances with public figures such as JAY-Z, Meek Mill, and Prince, his endeavors shine a light on pathways out of systemic disenfranchisement and toward collective prosperity.

Apart from these ventures, Van's legacy includes pioneering projects like the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, Color of Change, Green For All, #YesWeCode, and more. His accolades range from the Lumiere Award to an Emmy, reflecting his dedication and drive. #vanjones #JeffBezos #politics #tech #business",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tjWeQ92_lag/default.jpg,Earn Your Leisure,none,,tjWeQ92_lag,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjWeQ92_lag,84.58333333333333,242166,5057,0,525,0.0007505646208301187

In this lively presentation Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO of Amazon.com discusses many of the technological advances that have enabled Amazon.com to be the ""earth's most customer centric company"". Bezos talks about Amazon's first 30 days of operation, shows the very first home page and explains how the existence of a little known book warehouse in Roseburg Oregon led to the decision to locate Amazon in Seattle. Since 1997, Amazon has spent $800 million on technology, more than it has spent on either warehousing or marketing. A self-proclaimed ""EECS-geek"", Bezos tells of technological advances that have not only enabled customers to find products, (and now at 28 million items), enabled products to find customers. Hear how Amazon developed ""real time personalization"", how the company performs ""active experiments"" and learn more about salad spinners than you could ever imagine. Also appearing is MIT alum Robert Frederick, Manager of Amazon Net Services. Frederick explains how these services enable other retail services to interact with Amazon. Hear how the company that ""runs on computer science"" plans for more technological advances in the future.

2024-04-16T12:00:39Z,UCGrHwk-y7ERaq7bCSjZYf1A,"Working With Jeff Bezos, Navigating Sexism at Amazon With Exit Interview’s Kristi Coulter","Ever wondered what it's like to work at Amazon? I mean, if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere, just like New York, right? It feels like after you’ve done time at Amazon, your meal ticket is punched, and you’ll have a cascade of job offers and great opportunities thereafter. But would you give your soul in exchange for a career at Amazon?

In this episode, I have Kristi Coulter, a brilliant author who wrote the book Exit Interview. She's also a writing professor and an editorial coach, so she helps people get their books into the world.

Exit Interview is about Kristi's experience of 12 years at Amazon corporate. It is an incisive, hilarious book, and as a woman reading it, I felt it was so needed in the literary world. We needed someone to voice what was happening on the inside in corporate employment. 

We get into the sexism and double standards she faced, her tumultuous attempts to advance up the Amazon career ladder, her relationship with ambition, her sobriety journey, and how she has both learned - and proven - that it is never too late to change in life. She also recounts how Amazon - and specifically, Jeff Bezos - responded to the famous New York Times expose of Amazon by Jodi Kantor (who also broke the Harvey Weinstein abuse scandal). You definitely don’t want to miss that story.

And by the way, the brutal culture Kristi experienced at work is not unique to Amazon, but is something people from many in tech can relate to, so I found it cathartic to read.

So, if you’re wondering, ""Oh, Amazon, what's it like there?"" join us as we peel back the mystique and aura of Amazon. Don’t worry, we’ll get some solid and entertaining Jeff Bezos anecdotes up in there.

""I know there's this myth that people who make that kind of money aren't really working. But I could tell you, at Amazon, those people were working insanely hard. Like so hard that I would think, you know, you're worth tens of millions of dollars, why are you answering emails on Sunday night? … Why don't you go on more vacations? Like you have so much money. Right. I was like, give me that money, and I will show you how it's done.""

Jeff Bezos, il fondatore di Amazon, ha registrato lunedi' un incremento record del suo patrimonio netto, 13 miliardi di dollari: lo ha rilevato Bloomberg, segnalando che si tratta del balzo in avanti più cospicuo mai realizzato da un individuo da quando il Bloomberg Billionaires Index è stato creato.
Se Jeff Bezos è arrivato a diventare l’uomo più facoltoso sulla faccia della Terra, lo deve soprattutto a sé stesso.
Il colosso dell’e-commerce amplia la sperimentazione del servizio di consegna automatizzata negli Usa con i sui robot a sei ruote.
Nell’attesa di dare il via alle consegne dal cielo via drone, Amazon resta con i “piedi” per terra e prosegue nell’ampliamento dei test per le consegne tramite il suo robot denominato Scout.

Ma questi sono soltanto i risultati riconducibili ad Amazon. Bezos, infatti, è molto di più e ha legato il proprio nome a molti altri marchi prestigiosi. Nel 2000 ha fondato la Blue Origin, una start up per voli spaziali umani che nel 2019 doveva effettuare i primi lanci turistici.
Insomma un vero e proprio uomo che ha capito come fare soldi e guadagnare!

💰 Learn The Fastest Way To Become A Millionaire 👉 
https://millionairesecrets.com/

Today’s interview for Millionaire Secrets is with Steve & Karen Anderson - authors of the bestselling book: ""The Bezos Letters: 14 Principles To Grow Your Business Like Amazon"".

I found this whole discussion totally fascinating and I could literally talk for hours-upon-hours with Steve and Karen about the inner-working of Jeff Bezos’s mind.

He’s one of those rare individuals that not only dreams big - but then truly holds the belief that those dreams are possible.

And then takes the necessary action to make them happen. 

From listening to Steve & Karen today, we learn that Jeff Bezos has some unwavering and overarching principles. Rules that he’s used to guide himself through every decision (from big to small) in the growth of Amazon. 

It’s about building a culture where every individual is believing in the same high-moral standards.

That’s why I loved this chat so much. 

I resonate with it because it’s exactly what I try to do here at ENTRE also!

And what’s super-exciting - all of these learnings are applicable to your business too.

Learn more about Jeff Bezos' story and purchase The Everything Store.

The book, The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon, applies whether you're an entrepreneur now, or dreaming of bigger things in the future. 

As you read the book, you might notice that Bezos was very aggressive, maybe to a fault at points, but it made him who he was.

At his 2010 Princeton commencement speech, he said, ""In the end, we are our choices.""

He took the path less trod upon, and he was so much happier for it.

In addition, he also announced the Blue Moon lunar lander, which is capable of taking people and payloads to the lunar surface. Below you’ll find more information about these announcements.
 
Blue Moon lunar lander: Blue Origin announced Blue Moon, its large lunar lander capable of delivering multiple metric tons of payload to the lunar surface based on configuration and mission. The cargo variant revealed today can carry 3.6 metric tons to the surface. We have also designed a variant of the lander that can stretch to be capable of carrying a 6.5-metric-ton, human-rated ascent stage. Blue also announced it can meet the current Administration's goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar lander. 
 
BE-7 engine: The Blue Moon lunar lander will be powered by the BE-7 engine, a new addition to Blue Origin’s family of engines. The BE-7’s 40 kN (10,000 lbf) thrust is designed for large lunar payload transport. The engine’s propellants are a highly-efficient combination of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The BE-7 will have its first hotfire this summer. The engine will be available for sale to other companies for use in in-space and lander applications.
 
Club For the Future: A non-profit founded by Blue Origin dedicated to inspiring and engaging the next generation of dreamers and space entrepreneurs as we journey to preserve Earth and unlock the potential of living and working in space. The Club will bring together K-12 students, educators and leaders for campaigns and initiatives utilizing Blue Origin’s unique access to space. The Club’s first activity will be to send a postcard to space and back on a future New Shepard mission—the first ever space mail. Learn more on the website (www.clubforfuture.org).

After Mike had received his degree from the University of New Mexico, the family moved to Houston, Texas, so that he could begin working as an engineer for Exxon.[22] Jeff Bezos attended a Montessori school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he was two years old.[23] Jeff Bezos attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.[24] Bezos' maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.[25] Gise retired early to his family's ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Bezos would spend many summers in his youth.[26] Bezos would later purchase this ranch and expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117 ha) to 300,000 acres (121,406 ha).[27][28] Bezos displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency, and once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room.[29][30] The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Bezos attended Miami Palmetto High School.[31][32] While Bezos was in high school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift.[33]

Bezos attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,[34][35] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[34] In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention ""to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park"".[36] In 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a 4.2 GPA and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree (B.S.E.) in electrical engineering and computer science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[37][38] While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of the Quadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[39] In addition, he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS).[40]

Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, recently sat down with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to talk about the early days of creating Amazon, what he's learned since then, how he funds his rocket company, Blue Origin, and what it's like when the president of the United States is your biggest critic. The sit-down interview happened in Berlin, where Bezos received the Axel Springer Award 2018.

He decided to give it all up and drive to Seattle with his wife, in a used car, to start a business in their garage. He was betting his own savings — and his parents’ and friends’ — on a totally untried notion: that people would buy books through a little-known network of computers called the Internet.

Jeff Bezos was convinced that this global network, primarily the domain of academics and government scientists, could become a vibrant new venue for commerce, with the right product and the right plan. Almost overnight, the company Bezos started, Amazon.com, changed the book-buying habits of a nation. Bezos and his investors found their shares in the company worth billions.

At the turn of the 21st century, the Internet bubble burst, and fortunes seemingly made overnight literally vanished. Yet Amazon flowed on like its mighty namesake, still expanding, but also showing profits, while other promising start-ups faded from the scene. Once-daunting competitors had become grateful partners. The vision of Jeff Bezos had prevailed, and the world of commerce had changed forever.

Jason hosts the very popular Rework podcast, and has written and co-authored numerous best-sellers including Rework, Getting Real and it doesn't have to be crazy at work.

In today's day and age there is a common belief that to be successful we must burn ourselves into the ground. Hustle and the grind are celebrated, and whilst they may be important in some aspects, Jason argues that there may be another way to achieve success and fulfilment.

In this episode we discuss how a multi-billion dollar company like Basecamp functions, lessons Jason learned from his parents and how he will teach his kids, the value of time, parenting lessons, productivity tools, lessons Jason's learned from working with Jeff Bezos, winning at business and much much more.

I must warn you, Jason's philosophy is infectious.

I hope you enjoy this episode with the hugely respected Jason Fried.

00:25  Pichai: ""We value the freedom of opinion in our society"". Clash of words ignited between Congressman Jordan and Google CEO Pichai,
00:25 Congressman Jordan to Pichai: ""This is a simple question. Yes or no?"" After all, you supported the Clinton campaign in 2016. I wanna know from them if you're gonna repeat your behavior in 2020 exactly as you did then when you helped Joe Biden trying to win the ekection”.
05:00 Pichai: ""I promise you that we will not do that"".
05:03 Price hikes at Amazon! Representative Mary Gay Scanlon interviews Amazon boss Jeff Bezos as a fierce argument breaks out between Congressman Jordan and committee chairman Cicilline. A loud argument erupts before the questioning can continue. Congressman Mary Gay Scanlon asks Jeff Bezos about Amazon's influence on www.Diapers.com Bezos is accused of using aggressive methods of influence in the diaper market. The diapers product is a competitive market that is very large.  Medium-sized families are severely affected by the price hikes.
11:02 Congressman Joe Neguse asks Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg about competitors that have disappeared from the market since the creation of Facebook (2004). It's about Facebook's monopoly and the methods Facebook uses to wipe out its competitors. Instagram is used as an example. Will Facebook ever try to buy Google?
16:36 Congresswoman Lucy McBath asks Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, why does Amazon intimidate its partners?  An Amazon contractor testifies via audio recording how she has been aggressively influenced by Amazon and how Amazon has literally destroyed her business. Why does Amazon ruin its customers? Amazon has a strategy of violence against its distribution partners. Bezos opposes and rejects that question
17:04 Congresswoman Lucy McBath shows a dramatic audio with word caps in which an Amazon partner asks Jeff Bezos to help him her to be treated fairly and equitably - as business partners should be. Amazon is the only source of survival for many business partners. Is Amazon a monopoly of fear and panic?
22:48 Congressman Cicilline holds an intervening remark towards Jeff Bezos and says that Amazon controls 77% of the industry. Amazon partners are considered as internal competitors and treated as such by Amazon. Amazon is driving its partners into bankruptcy. Amazon is poison. Amazon is even compared to a lethal drug.
29:32 Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner interviews Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai on various bit tech issues and the law of tech regulation
34:06 Congressman Pramila Jayapal interviews Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. The Congresswoman says Facebook is simply copying ideas from competitors. She asks: ""How many business ideas from competitors has Facebook copied since 2008? Has Facebook threatened to clone competitors? Is Facebook threatening competitors? Instagram founder Mike Krieger accused  Facebook of threatening and intimidation"". Congressman Jayapal puts Zuckerberg in distress.
39:35 Congressman Ken Buck says that Amazon allows fake products to be offered on its platform.  Then Congressman Ken Buck is asking Apple boss Tim Cook, Google boss Pichai, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos whether they are willing to sell products made by  child labor and modern slavery or forced labor?
44:31 Congressman Jamie Raskin uses the term cyber-robber barons, referring to Amazon boss Jeff Bezos in his questioning.

2021-07-20T16:36:06Z,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,LIVE: Jeff Bezos and Crew Speak Following Blue Origin's Successful Trip to Space,"(July 20) Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos and three others landed safely after Blue Origin’s first flight to space with passengers aboard, a key milestone in the company’s effort to make space tourism viable.

The company’s capsule touched down in West Texas at about 8:22 a.m. local time Tuesday, roughly 10 minutes after it launched on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket. The crew experienced a few moments of weightlessness as the spaceship soared past the Karman line at an altitude of about 62 miles (100 km) above the Earth. The capsule then parachuted back.

“Best day ever,” Bezos said on a livestream of the suborbital flight provided by Blue Origin, shortly before the capsule landed.

He then exited the capsule, wearing a cowboy hat, with his fellow passengers: his brother, Mark; Wally Funk, 82, a former astronaut trainee; and Oliver Daemen, the 18-year-old son of a Dutch financier. Funk was the oldest person to travel to space and Daemen the youngest.

The mission caps a landmark month for space-tourism ventures, following by nine days a trip to the heavens by U.K. billionaire Richard Branson on a special plane made by Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc., a rival to Blue Origin. Both companies are set to expand operations with plans to entice super-wealthy customers to pay big money for a unique travel experience.

The events surrounding the divorce of Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott in early 2019 were almost too far-fetched to believe. A day after they announced the dissolution of their 25-year marriage with a tweet, the National Enquirer published an explosive story, detailing Bezos’s extramarital relationship. Reporter Brad Stone tells the dramatic story of Bezos’s evolving personal life and its impact on the tech giant he founded — leading to his ultimate decision to step back from the role of CEO.

Foundering is an award-winning, serialized podcast from the journalists at Bloomberg Technology. Each season, Foundering brings you inside a different high-stakes drama from the technology industry, where its companies are wielding unprecedented capital and power.

Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has become the richest man in the world. Every second Euro in online trading is spent at Amazon. Is the IT giant, with its unabated growth, about to turn our economic system upside down?

Amazon is a machine that can simultaneously observe, compare and analyze more than 300 million people worldwide. The company is not just a marketplace, market supervisor and provider of more and more services and consumer items - it also controls all the data streams in this market and uses them to its own benefit. Who suspects that a single click on an Amazon page will forward information to the company that fills a printed DIN-A-4 page? A conversation with Alexa, watching a streaming offer on Amazon-Prime, ordering vegetables via Amazon-Fresh - all this put together creates a whole library of information about every customer. The group collects everything - it just won’t reveal what conclusions it draws from it. What would be possible if data from other, new business areas were added? In the USA, Amazon is also active in the health and insurance sectors, and police officers are using its facial recognition software to search for wanted persons.

Amazon.com started off delivering books through the mail. But its visionary founder, Jeff Bezos, wasn't content with being a bookseller. He wanted Amazon to become the everything store, offering limitless selection and seductive convenience at disruptively low prices. To do so, he developed a corporate culture of relentless ambition and secrecy that's never been cracked. Until now. Brad Stone enjoyed unprecedented access to current and former Amazon employees and Bezos family members, giving readers the first in-depth, fly-on-the-wall account of life at Amazon.

According to Walter Isaacson, author of Steve Jobs, ""Jeff Bezos is one of the most visionary, focused, and tenacious innovators of our era, and like Steve Jobs he transforms and invents industries. Brad Stone captures his passion and brilliance in this well-reported and compelling narrative.""

John tells us why he decided to switch from Apple, just two months before the launch of the iPhone X, and why he's already regretting it - this is more than just another ""Apple v Android"" war of words though - there's some real business lessons in there.

This month's book of the month was ""The Everything Store"" by Brad Stone, which looks at the meteoric rise of Jeff Bezos, and Amazon.com, which leads John to the conclusion that ""he's a bit of an evil b*****d really isn't he?""

Jason once again tells us how simple running a successful business is - and it all comes down to doing ""what you say you're going to do.""

John shares some of his strategies for curing overwhelm (""getting rid of your phone"" is one of them, though that may simply related to his Samsung woes this month)

John also tells us what he learnt meeting Charlie Mullins, the ""millionaire plumber"" from Pimlico Plumbers last month.

For its first programme of the new century, 60 Minutes takes viewers on an astounding journey into the future. The guides will include sci-fi visionary, Arthur C. Clarke, Internet guru Jeff Bezos, President of the United States Bill Clinton, NSW Premier Bob Carr, author and futurist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki, NASA’s chief scientist Dennis Bushnell and business forecaster Phil Ruthven. With their help, 60 Minutes leaps into a world of 150 year-olds with the faces and bodies of 25-year-olds, into a world where bodies grow their own spare parts, where space becomes a desirable address, where planes seat 800 people and fly Sydney to London at twice the speed of sound while family cars sprout wings too. We hear predictions of beds that will calculate how long we need to sleep, of fridges that order our groceries and our looming battle to stave off environmental disaster.

This was some kind of an interview and Bezos gave it because he actually received the Axel Springer award in Berlin or at least  interview was in  Berlin. There he was talking to Mathias Döpfner  the CEO of Alex Springer. It was quite an interesting start of the  interview,  it gave a few insides of Jeff Bezos upcoming and why his grandfather is such an incredible important person for him.  additionally to that Bezos speaks about what drives him and what actually made him kind of pursuing his streams,  which was quite interesting.

 I hope you're getting something out of it and I'm seeing whether I'm just going to do such kind of interviews or articles in general or if I'm going to do it in a different way or if I'm just still just keeping to go through book summaries.

I as always hope that you get a lot out of that!

WHAT WOULD BEZOS DO: Steve Anderson is the quintessential business Risk and Growth Expert. And a healthy business is one that can, and does, take care of its people. Just like a business, recovery from a mental health problem or illness requires a degree of healthy risk. That’s why mental health expert Peter Diaz decided to pick Steve Anderson’s brain; this will help us learn to seek and use risk to our advantage. In this interview Steve, the author of international bestseller ‘The Bezos Letters: 14 Principles to Grow Your Business Like Amazon’ explains how to embrace risk as a key to growth and thriving. Key elements also required for a healthy mind. Risk & Growth Expert Steve Anderson shows business owners, executives, and leaders how to apply Bezos’ same practices to watch their business become more efficient, productive, and successful—fast!

Steve Anderson draws on a life time of experience in the insurance industry. Steve’s authority on risk is proven by his hundreds of thousands of followers and by the fact that Steve is recognised by LinkedIn as one of the world’s most influential thought leaders.

In this interview, Steve Anderson explains the principles that allowed Jeff Bezos to create Amazon, one of the world’s most valuable companies and, in the process, became the world’s richest person. Amazon was the fastest company to reach $100 billion in sales ever. And, he started by selling books online.

2024-03-11T15:53:50Z,UCLe0sykRt5eKIGYEnWzqWxQ,I figured out why Jeff Bezos is so successful | Jeff Bezos & Lex Fridman Podcast Review,"Today, we're delving into an exclusive interview featuring none other than Jeff Bezos, the visionary behind Amazon. This podcast took place approximately 2 months ago when Lex Friedman conducted an in-depth conversation with Jeff Bezos. During the interview, Bezos discussed various topics including the Amazon empire, Blue Origin, his family, and his wealth. Often, we absorb knowledge effortlessly, yet applying it to our own lives can be challenging due to the differing perspectives of the speaker and the listener. This disconnect can cause us to overlook important details. That's why I find it beneficial to pause, rewind, and analyze.

The Amazon founder, estimated to be worth $124 billion, suggested in an interview on CNN that he would donate most of his money to charity

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he will give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime, becoming the latest billionaire to pledge to donate much of his vast fortune.

Bezos, whose “real-time” worth Forbes magazine estimates at roughly $124.1 billion, made the announcement in a joint CNN interview with his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez that was released on Monday. The billionaire didn’t specify how - or to whom - he will give away the money, but said the couple were building the “capacity” to do it.

“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” Bezos said during the interview. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work and very smart teammates. And I’m finding - and Lauren’s finding - that philanthropy is very similar. It’s not easy. It’s really hard.”

Bezos had been criticized in the past for not signing the Giving Pledge, the campaign launched by Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffet to encourage billionaires to donate the majority of their wealth through philanthropy.

Jeff Bezos says he will give away most of his massive fortune

The Amazon founder, who has a net worth north of $124 billion, joins a growing list of billionaires who have made similar pledges

Bezos has a net worth of $124 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In an interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas, the world’s fourth-richest man said that he and his partner, Lauren Sanchez, were “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”

“And the hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said in the interview from his D.C. home. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that philanthropy is very similar.”

Bezos made much of his fortune by founding and running e-commerce giant Amazon, which he started in late 1994. He stepped down as CEO of the company last year but remains executive chair of its board. He also owns The Washington Post and Blue Origin, a rocket company.

Amazon plans to cut thousands of jobs, report says

Bezos has been criticized in the past for not signing the Giving Pledge, a movement that requires signatories to give away most of their wealth during their lifetimes or in their wills. Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Bill Gates and Bezos’s ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, have all signed it.

Bezos did not say during the interview whether he planned to sign the pledge.

Scott, who was married to Bezos for 25 years before they divorced in 2019, has become a prominent philanthropist. Two days after Bezos’s CNN interview, Scott said she had given almost $2 billion in donations over the past seven months. The money went to 343 organizations that help “people from underserved communities,” Scott wrote in a Monday blog post that listed all the groups. It’s the second philanthropic announcement this year from Scott, following news in March that she had given $3.8 billion to 465 nonprofits over the previous nine months.

He will remain the Executive Chair of the board while Andy Jassy will take over as Amazon CEO. BOOM's Govindraj Ethiraj interviews Haresh Chawla, Partner, True North and Sharad Sharma, Co-Founder, iSPIRT on the ramifications of this move on the e-commerce industry and the right time to transition in such situations through an Indian lens.

Haresh Chawla says that Amazon has now become a well-oiled machine of its own. Founders look for successors who can carry the DNA of the brand forward. It is noteworthy that Andy Jassy is construed as a person who is like Amazon - aggressive, focused, willingness to make mistakes and the willingness to embrace failure. 

Sharad Sharma says that companies grow in innings. This move most likely means a break-up of Amazon. Regulatory pressures are high and Jeff Bezos resigning will allow them to restructure the business. The Cloud and the retail business are fundamentally different businesses and Andy Jassy managed to integrate thinking about commerce when thinking about non finished goods.

Jeff Bezos came from adversity with his father being an 16 year-old immigrant from Cuba & his mother having him when she was 17. He did not grow up rich but had a great & supporting family. At the of 30 he decided to quit his well-payed & secure job & found Amazon. The little operation for selling books online, with great struggle raised 1 million dollars from 20 investors for 20% of the company. Just 5 years later its stock price first skyrocketed over 62 times only to plummet over 92% in the burst of the tech-bubble. From then on with a great focus, unchallenged long-term thinking, obsession for the customer & strive for experimenting & innovation, Jeff Bezos leads Amazon to be the second US public company to reach 1 trillion market capitalization & has over 180 billion in annual revenue!

Should Bezos give money away, and, if so, how much? Is it just a matter of personal preference as to how much money (if any) one should give away? Being a selfish person without being a bad person. Is selfishness sometimes bad and sometimes not? How should “selfish” be defined? Passive harm. Employee benefits.

However, such a journey has been far from simple. Jeff Bezos has had to take risks, endure downs, re-try after numerous failures and of course compete with the one and only Elon Musk. The rewards for Jeff Bezos have been incomprehensible, ending 2020 with a net worth of $182 billion dollars. This is, the Full Story of Jeff Bezos.

As I do with all my celebrity readings, I start with a brief overview of their BIRTH CHART (you can go straight to his reading at the 4 minute mark). The Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has a Capricorn stellium in his 10th house (career) -- he was destined for fame and money. His reading was a little crazy - expect some big changes this week. 

Check out Jeff Bezos tarot reading, which is for fun and entertainment. I do not know him or his family or his life personally.

2018-05-26T12:07:50Z,UCw0uQHve23oMWgQcTTpgQsQ,14 Leadership Principles at Amazon via Jeff Bezos,"Coaching and Training:  https://bestofmany.com/

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job"". 

Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here"". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 

Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

Erfolg ohne Freiheit ist Misserfolg. Freiheit kann man erschaffen. Jeder. Im Freiheitspodcast Mach.Dich.Frei. von Dr. Susanne Vornweg und Dr. Hartmut Voss-Vornweg lernst du in einzelnen Storys und inspirierenden Interviews die Strategien von erfolgreichen Unternehmern und Prominenten. Du lernst in Experten-Interviews, welchen Stellenwert die Freiheit für erfolgreiche Unternehmer zunehmend gewinnt, um dauerhaft frei und erfolgreich zu bleiben. Wie sie die richtige Einstellung zum Erfolg gefunden haben, wie sie echte Freiheit generieren und weshalb ihnen das so wichtig ist. Das Hamsterrad ist kein Erfolgskriterium. Das richtige Mindset ist wichtig, um in Freiheit viel Geld zu verdienen, glückliche Beziehungen zu führen, mit sich selbst  im Einklang zu sein und dadurch Beruf und Familie bestens miteinander in Freiheit vereinbaren zu können. Einschalten. Zuhören. Sich motivieren und inspirieren. Lernen. Tun. Erfolg haben. Wirklich frei und unabhängig sein. Viele Storys sind inspiriert von Persönlichkeiten wie Sir Richard Branson, T. Harv Eker, Tony Robbins, John Lee Dumas, Tim Ferriss, Bodo Schäfer, Dirk Kreuter, Alex Fischer, Gerd Kommer, Thomas Knedel, Gerald Hörhan, Christoph Juhn. Spannend für Selbständige, Freiberufler, angestellte Führungskräfte, Jungunternehmer und Unternehmensgründer, alle Menschen, denen die persönliche Freiheit wichtig ist, die nicht weiterhin Zeit gegen Geld tauschen und nicht für die Träume anderer arbeiten wollen.

As Americans gear up for the holiday season, he urged small businesses and individuals that if they intended to spend on big-ticket items this holiday season, they should rather keep that plan on hold. So why is Bezos putting out such signals, especially when his platform aims at encouraging people to spend more? Well, the answer could be the potentials of a recession and also 4-decade high inflation that American are faced with. Remember this also comes at a time when Amazon itself has laid off over 10,000 employees. So, how should one be navigating these downturns? Is Bezos' warning not applicable to the Indian consumers or can it prepare is for a recession hit winter?

He was born on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Bezos founded Amazon.com in 1994 as an online bookstore. Over the years, he transformed the company into a global e-commerce giant, offering a wide range of products and services, including books, electronics, clothing, and cloud computing services through Amazon Web Services (AWS). Under Bezos' leadership, Amazon expanded its operations and became a dominant force in the retail industry, revolutionizing the way people shop and changing the face of e-commerce.

Bezos is widely recognized for his vision and innovation, as well as his relentless focus on customer satisfaction. He played a crucial role in the development of technologies such as one-click purchasing, personalized recommendations, and the Kindle e-reader, which further propelled Amazon's growth.

In addition to Amazon, Bezos has invested in various other ventures and industries. Notably, he is the founder of aerospace manufacturer and spaceflight services company Blue Origin, with the goal of making space travel more accessible and affordable.

Jeff Bezos stepped down as CEO of Amazon in July 2021, handing over the position to Andy Jassy, the former head of AWS. However, Bezos remains involved with Amazon as the executive chairman and continues to have a significant influence on the company's direction and initiatives.

Bezos is regarded as one of the world's wealthiest individuals, and his success and entrepreneurial journey have made him a prominent figure in the business world.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0iyKsl1u3WE/default.jpg,Popular Quotes,none,,0iyKsl1u3WE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iyKsl1u3WE,21.233333333333334,188,3,0,0,0.0002999385760631412

00:00 1. Customer obsession: start with the customer and work backwards; work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust; pay attention to competitors, but keep obsessing over customers
2. Ownership: think like an owner, long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results; act on behalf of the entire company, not just for your own team; never say “that’s not my job""
3. Invent and simplify: expect and require innovation and invention from your team and always find ways to simplify; be externally aware, always look for new ideas from everywhere, and don’t be limited by “not invented here""
4. Leaders are right a lot 1:52 : you have strong judgment and good instincts; you seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm your beliefs
5. Frugality 3:50 : accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense
6. Hire and develop the best 5:01 : raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion; recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization; develop leaders and take seriously your role in coaching others
7. Earn trust 5:05 : listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. Be vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing; leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume; benchmark yourself and your team against the best.
8. Insist on the highest standards 7:42 : you have relentlessly high standards - many may think these standards are unreasonably high; you are continually raising the bar and driving your team to deliver high quality products, services and processes; defects do not get sent down the line and problems are fixed so they stay fixed
9. Bias for action 11:34 : speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
10. Learn and be curious 11:34 : you are never done learning and you always seek to improve; you are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them
11. Have backbone. Disagree and commit 13:26 : respectfully challenge decisions when you disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting; have conviction and be tenacious; do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion; once a decision is determined, commit to it.
12. Dive deep 13:26 : operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and be skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath you.
13. Think big 16:04 : thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. Think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
14. Deliver results 16:04 : focus on the key inputs for your business and deliver with the right quality and in a timely fashion; despite setbacks, rise to the occasion and never settle",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B-xdfQv3I1k/default.jpg,Dan Croitor,none,,B-xdfQv3I1k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-xdfQv3I1k,20.35,1104025,12294,0,234,1.9818224927803385e-07
